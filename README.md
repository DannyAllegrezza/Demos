# Demos
A collection of common computer science data structures and algorithms, implemented using C#. Feel free to peek at this repository if you want to see basic implementations of common data structures, such as:

* Binary Trees
* Graphs
* Hash Tables
* Linked Lists
* Queues
* Stacks
* Tries

There is also a section devoted towards common searching and sorting algorithms. 

**NOTE:** The code shown here is for educational purposes/my own personal use. For example, please do not use my hand-rolled implementation of a `Stack` in production :smile:
